            <h2> What it says</h2>

            <p> We hold these truths to be <strong> self-evident,</strong> that all men are <em> created equal,</em> <br>
                 that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, <br>
                 that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.‚Äù </p>

            <h2>Why are we upset</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
                <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended <br>
                     in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected <br>
                     to attend to them.</li>
            </ol>
